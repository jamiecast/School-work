# School Work
Contains most of the coding and modeling work I have completed during my time at CSU. This repository is organized by the different classes. There is a large mix of different programming languages and types of projects being worked on.
The biggest one is the folder for **MECH 476: Data Analysis in R** which contains all of the work that I have completed in that course while learning R and Rstudio.
