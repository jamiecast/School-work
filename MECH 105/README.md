# MECH105-Algorithms
Algorithms created for Mech 105: Numerical methods

### This repository contains the following alrogithms
- **falseposition**: a bracketed root finding algorithm that uses the false position method.
- **luFactor**: takes a uniform matrix and decomposes it into seperate lower and upper triangular matrices.
- **Simpson**: implementation of the Simpson's 1/3 algorithm to estimate an integral.
